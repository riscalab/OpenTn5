# OpenTn5: Open-Source Resource for Robust and Scalable Tn5 Transposase Purification and Characterization
### Abstract: 
Tagmentation streamlines sequencing library preparation by leveraging the bacterial cut-and-paste Tn5 transposase for DNA fragmentation and sequencing adapter addition. Here we present an open-source protocol for the generation of multi-purpose hyperactive Tn5 transposase, pG-Tn5E54K, L372P, yielding multi-milligram quantities per liter of E. coli culture, sufficient for thousands of tagmentation reactions. Benchmarking shows effectiveness for CUT&Tag, as well as bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq, with the enzyme retaining activity in storage for more than a year.
